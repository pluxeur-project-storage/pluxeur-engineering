**The timeline of the update can be found at the bottom of the post.**

## Reason for relocation
We relocated all of our websites/data located on VE1 to NE2, this is so we can remove the VE1 from our workflow. As this was a very old & slow servers which took a while to update things on so we are moving to NE2, which is a faster server & much easier to update with continuous integration.

## So what did we do
- We moved **Pluxeur Blog**, **Pluxeur FAQ** from VE1 to NE2
- We moved **Digital Dev** from VE1 to NE1

## Future plans
- We are planning on removing websites RE1 & ZH1 from our workflow to streamline our workflow.
- Planning on moving all of our API services to RE1.
- **We want to engineer our own Status page so we can prevent the same issue**
